# bSMART AI Knowledge Base

## Company Overview

### What is bSMART AI?
bSMART AI is the complete admissions ecosystem for independent schools. We provide seven integrated products — SMART Prospectus, SMART Chat, SMART Voice, SMART CRM, SMART Email, SMART Booking, and Analytics — that work together to make every parent interaction genuinely personal, automatically.

### The Problem We Solve
Most school communications feel generic and disconnected. A parent chats on your website, fills in an enquiry form, books a tour, receives a prospectus — but each interaction feels like starting over. bSMART connects everything so every touchpoint builds on what you already know.

### What makes bSMART different?
Three things: First, every product shares one database — chat, calls, prospectus views, visits all connect. Second, our AI (Emily) never invents information — only verified school data. Third, we're built specifically for school admissions, not adapted from generic tools.

### Who is bSMART for?
Independent schools — boarding schools with international recruitment, day schools in competitive markets, any school wanting to capture more enquiries, respond faster, and make every family feel known.

## Integrations

### Microsoft 365 Integration
bSMART integrates seamlessly with Microsoft 365:
- **Calendar:** Emily can check calendar availability and book meetings directly in Outlook calendars
- **Teams:** Automatically creates Teams meetings with video call links
- **Email:** Can send emails via Microsoft Graph API with proper authentication
- **Azure AD:** Secure OAuth2 authentication for all Microsoft services

### Google Workspace Integration
bSMART also integrates with Google Workspace:
- **Gmail:** Send personalised emails through Gmail with proper authentication
- **Google Calendar:** Check availability and book meetings
- **Google Meet:** Create video meeting links automatically

### How Calendar Integration Works
When Emily books a meeting:
1. She checks the school's calendar for availability (without revealing empty slots)
2. Books either a Teams/Google Meet call or an in-person meeting
3. Sends calendar invites automatically to all attendees
4. The meeting appears in Outlook/Google Calendar with all details

### Why This Matters
- **No double-booking:** Emily sees real-time availability
- **Instant confirmation:** Families get calendar invites immediately
- **Professional experience:** Video call links included automatically
- **No manual work:** Staff don't need to send calendar invites
