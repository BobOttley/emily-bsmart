# bSMART AI Knowledge Base

## Company Overview

### What is bSMART AI?
bSMART AI is the complete admissions ecosystem for independent schools. We provide eight integrated products — SMART Prospectus, SMART Chat, SMART Voice, SMART Phone, SMART CRM, SMART Email, SMART Booking, and Analytics — that work together to make every parent interaction genuinely personal, automatically.

### The Problem We Solve
Most school communications feel generic and disconnected. A parent chats on your website, fills in an enquiry form, books a tour, receives a prospectus — but each interaction feels like starting over. bSMART connects everything so every touchpoint builds on what you already know.

### What makes bSMART different?
Three things: First, every product shares one database — chat, calls, prospectus views, visits all connect. Second, our AI (Emily) never invents information — only verified school data. Third, we're built specifically for school admissions, not adapted from generic tools.

### Who is bSMART for?
Independent schools — boarding schools with international recruitment, day schools in competitive markets, any school wanting to capture more enquiries, respond faster, and make every family feel known.

## How It Works Together

When a parent visits your website:
1. Emily (SMART Chat) greets them and answers questions
2. If they want a prospectus, SMART Prospectus creates a personalised version
3. They can book a visit through SMART Booking
4. Everything is logged in SMART CRM
5. SMART Email sends personalised follow-ups
6. If they call, SMART Phone handles it and logs to CRM
7. Analytics shows you the complete picture

Every touchpoint builds on the last. No family ever feels like they're starting over.
